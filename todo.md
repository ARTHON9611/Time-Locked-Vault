- [x] Configure project dependencies

## Core Functionality Implementation
- [x] Implement multi-token deposits
  - [x] Support for SOL, SPL tokens, and wrapped assets
  - [x] Include token type, amount, unlock timestamp, and unique identifier
- [x] Implement time-locked vault logic
  - [x] Ensure funds remain inaccessible until unlock timestamp
  - [x] Implement secure withdrawal function
- [x] Implement multiple concurrent deposits
  - [x] Track deposits separately with unique identifiers
  - [x] Support different unlock times and token types
- [x] Implement withdrawal mechanism
  - [x] Verify depositor is the only one who can withdraw
  - [x] Enforce timestamp validation
  - [x] Prevent duplicate withdrawals and replay attacks

## Security Features
- [x] Implement reentrancy protection
- [x] Add unauthorized access prevention
- [x] Implement time manipulation safeguards
- [x] Handle edge cases (zero amount, past unlock time)

## Optimization
- [ ] Optimize gas usage with compressed data structures
- [ ] Minimize redundant writes
- [ ] Implement batch query support

## Event Emission & Logging
- [ ] Add events for deposits

- [ ] Emergency unlock request mechanism
- [ ] Deposit tagging system

## Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for all core functions
- [x] Test edge cases
- [x] Test security features
- [x] Test reentrancy prevention

## Documentation
- [x] Create README with usage guide
- [x] Document contract architecture
- [x] Add deployment instructions

## Frontend (Bonus)
- [ ] Create React + TailwindCSS + Solana wallet adapter frontend
- [ ] Implement deposit form
- [ ] Create "My Vaults" dashboard
- [ ] Add countdown timers
- [ ] Add transaction status indicators
